# 🚀 OpportunityX - Render Deployment Guide

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub
# Then connect it:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opportunityx.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Render

1. **Go to Render**: https://dashboard.render.com/
   
2. **Sign Up/Login**: 
   - Use GitHub to sign in (easiest)
   - Or create account with email

3. **Create New Static Site**:
   - Click **"New +"** button (top right)
   - Select **"Static Site"**

4. **Connect Repository**:
   - Click **"Connect a repository"**
   - Authorize Render to access your GitHub
   - Select your **opportunityx** repository
   - Click **"Connect"**

5. **Configure (Auto-detected from render.yaml)**:
   ```
   Name: opportunityx (or your custom name)
   Branch: main
   Build Command: pnpm install && pnpm run build
   Publish Directory: dist
   ```

6. **Click "Create Static Site"** 🎉

7. **Wait 2-3 Minutes**: Render will:
   - ✅ Install dependencies
   - ✅ Build your app

## 🔧 Manual Configuration (If render.yaml doesn't work)

If automatic detection fails, configure manually:

### Build Settings:
- **Build Command**: `pnpm install && pnpm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`

### Environment:
- **Node Version**: 18+ (usually auto-detected)

### Redirects:
- Already configured in `public/_redirects`
- Handles React Router SPA routing

---

## 🎯 Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your site on Render
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Custom Domain"**
4. Add your domain (e.g., `opportunityx.com`)
5. Update DNS records as instructed
6. SSL certificate auto-generated! 🔒

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### ❌ "Build failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed
- Ensure Node 18+ is used
- Check build logs for missing dependencies

### ❌ "Page not found" on refresh
**Solution**: 
- Verify `public/_redirects` file exists
- Content should be: `/*    /index.html   200`

### ❌ "Blank page after deployment"
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all imports in `main.tsx` are correct
- Ensure all CSS files are imported

### ❌ "Styles not loading"
**Solution**:
- Verify `index.html` includes the script tag
- Check Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh
